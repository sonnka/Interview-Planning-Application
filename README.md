## Project information
Interview planning application is a RESTful service designed for better communication between interviewers and candidates through coordinators.

Application supports next basic functionality:
  - Creating slots as Interviewer
  - Creating slots as Candidate
  - Creating bookings for already created Interviewer and Candidate slots as Coordinator

### Used technologies
- Java
- Spring
  - Boot
  - Data
    - Hibernate
  - Security
    - OAuth2
  - Web
- Facebook API

## API
This section describes all implemented and planned to implement endpoints.

### Authentication & authorization

#### Getting the JWT

To perform any authenticated or authorized request you should provide your Facebook Token to the next endpoint:

`POST /authenticate`

With requiered data parameter `{"facebookToken": "EAAHC..."}`.

As the response you will get JSON Web Token as `{"token": "eyJhb..."}`.

The possible exceptions are:
- 401 - bad_facebook_token_exception
- 401 - bad_credentials

Gained JWT should be put in request header as a parameter `Authorization` with value `Bearer eyJhb...`.

## Setting-up the project
This section describes all needed steps to launch the application.

### Getting the project
First of all, you need to get the project. You can do this by two ways:
- [Getting zip project file](#getting-zip-project-file)
- [Cloning the repository](#cloning-the-repository)

#### Getting zip project file
To download project in zip follow the [link](https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

After downloading, unzip the archive and go to __intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main__ directory.

#### Cloning the repository
To clone the repository run the console and type:

`git clone https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek.git`

After cloning is done change the directory to __intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main__ by the following command:

`cd intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main`

### Configuring docker
This section describes all needed steps to launch application via docker.

#### Configuring environmental variables
Before launching the application via docker, you need to created `api.env` file with next environment variables.
The example of such file represented in `example.env` file. The needed variables are:
- `APPLICATION_PORT` - port on which application will be run
- `JWT_SECRET` - defines secret work to assign the JWT
- `JWT_VALIDITY` - validity of JWT in seconds
- `FIRST_COORDINATOR_EMAIL` - facebook account attached email of first coordinator that will be automatically added to DB  
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` - application client id provided by facebook
- `FACEBOOK_SECRET` - application secret provided by facebook
- `FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI` - URI to which you will be redirected after oauth2. Configures by facebook application
- `HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO` - hibernate DDL launch mode:
  - `validate`: validates the schema, makes no changes to the database.
  - `update`: updates the schema.
  - `create`: creates the schema, destroying previous data.
  - `create-drop`: drop the schema when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly, typically when the application is stopped.
  - none: does nothing with the schema, makes no changes to the database.
- `DATABASE_PORT` - port on which database will be run
- `POSTGRES_USER` - name of default postgresql user
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - password of default postgresql user
- `POSTGRES_DB` - postgresql database name

#### Launching the application
Once the `api.env` is created with proper variables you can launch docker with application through running the following command:

`docker-compose --env-file api.env up`
